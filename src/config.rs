//! Compile-time configuration.
//!
//! `ekv` has some configuration settings that are set at compile time.
//!
//! They can be set in two ways:
//!
//! - Via Cargo features: enable a feature like `<name>-<value>`. `name` must be in lowercase and
//!   use dashes instead of underscores. For example. `max-page-count-1024`. Only a selection of values
//!   is available, check `Cargo.toml` for the list.
//! - Via environment variables at build time: set the variable named `EKV_<value>`. For example
//!   `EKV_MAX_PAGE_COUNT=1024 cargo build`. You can also set them in the `[env]` section of `.cargo/config.toml`.
//!   Any value can be set, unlike with Cargo features.
//!
//! Environment variables take precedence over Cargo features. If two Cargo features are enabled for the same setting
//! with different values, compilation fails.
//!
//! ## Compatibility warning
//!
//! Changing ANY of these configuration settings changes the on-disk format of the database. If you change
//! them, you won't be able to read databases written with a different configuration.
//!
//! Currently, mounting doesn't check the on-disk database uses the same configuration. Mounting a database
//! with a different configuration might succeed and then cause fun errors later, perhaps very rarely.
//! Always remember to format your flash device every time you change them.
